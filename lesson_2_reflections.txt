What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
A: A .git metadata is created in the current directory. When run git status, initial commit message should be seen. However, I got the following message:

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

	lesson_1_reflection.txt

I still don't know why. the git file is created which can be seen when running ls -a
gashfen (master #) reflections $ ls -a
.			.git
..			lesson_1_reflection.txt


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
A: Once the repository is initialzed in the working directory, you add the files in to to the staging area before making commit directly the files from the working directory. It's like an intermediator.
