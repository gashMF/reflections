What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
A: A .git metadata is created in the current directory. When run git status, initial commit message should be seen. However, I got the following message:

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

	lesson_1_reflection.txt

I still don't know why. the git file is created which can be seen when running ls -a
gashfen (master #) reflections $ ls -a
.			.git
..			lesson_1_reflection.txt
